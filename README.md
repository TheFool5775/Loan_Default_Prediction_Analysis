# Loan Default Prediction using Machine Learning Models

## Overview
This project aims to predict loan defaults based on various features of loan applicants using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing the dataset, we can identify key factors that contribute to loan defaults and develop predictive models that assist financial institutions in making informed lending decisions.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is `Loan_Default.csv`, which contains information about loan applicants and their loan statuses. The key features in the dataset include:

- **ID**: Unique identifier for each applicant.
- **Status**: Indicates whether the loan was defaulted (1) or not (0).
- **customer_age**: Age of the applicant.
- **customer_income**: Annual income of the applicant.
- **home_ownership**: Type of home ownership (e.g., OWN, RENT).
- **employment_duration**: Duration of employment in years.
- **loan_intent**: Purpose of the loan (e.g., EDUCATION, PERSONAL).
- **loan_grade**: Grade assigned to the loan based on risk.
- **loan_amnt**: Amount of the loan.
- **loan_int_rate**: Interest rate of the loan.
- **term_years**: Duration of the loan in years.
- **historical_default**: Historical default status of the applicant.
- **cred_hist_length**: Length of credit history in months.
